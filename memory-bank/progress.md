[2025-09-01 14:23:40] - ## Currency System Refactoring Complete

### What was done:
1. **Refactored Currency from string to entity**
   - Created Currency entity with ChatID association
   - Added exchange rates and base currency concept
   - Implemented currency conversion logic

2. **Updated all entities to use currency IDs**
   - User balances: map[int64]Decimal (currencyID -> amount)
   - Task rewards: use currencyID instead of currency code
   - Added ChatID to User and Task entities

3. **Created CurrencyRepository and Service**
   - Full CRUD operations for currencies
   - Exchange rate management
   - Currency conversion with base currency routing
   - Automatic base currency assignment for first currency

4. **Updated PostgreSQL schema**
   - New currencies table with chat_id and exchange rates
   - Modified user_balances to use currency_id
   - Added unique constraints for base currency per chat

5. **Comprehensive tests**
   - Currency creation and management
   - Exchange rate setting
   - Direct and indirect currency conversion
   - All tests passing

### Key benefits:
- Multiple chats can have their own currencies
- Flexible exchange rate system
- Clean separation between chats
- Ready for multi-tenant usage
