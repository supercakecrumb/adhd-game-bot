## Key User Flows

### 1. New User Onboarding
1. User starts Telegram bot (`/start`)
2. Bot creates user account and generates web login URL
3. User clicks web interface button
4. Authenticates and accesses full quest management

### 2. Quest Creation & Management
1. User creates dungeon (group) via web interface
2. Invites members via invite codes or Telegram groups
3. Creates quests with different reward modes
4. Members complete quests via web or Telegram bot
5. Points awarded automatically with streak bonuses

### 3. Daily Quest Workflow
1. Bot sends daily quest reminders to Telegram groups
2. Users complete quests via quick action buttons
3. Points awarded immediately
4. Progress tracked with streaks and statistics
5. Users spend points in shop for rewards

## Database Schema Overview

```sql
-- Core entities
users (id, telegram_user_id, username, balance, timezone)
dungeons (id, title, admin_user_id, telegram_chat_id, invite_code)
dungeon_members (dungeon_id, user_id, role)
quests (id, dungeon_id, title, mode, points_award, streak_enabled)
quest_completions (id, quest_id, user_id, points_awarded, completed_at)

-- Supporting systems
shop_items (id, dungeon_id, code, name, price)
purchases (id, user_id, item_id, total_cost)
telegram_sessions (telegram_user_id, session_token, expires_at)
idempotency_keys (key, operation, status, result)
```
